# VIBE-coding – Smart PYQ Learning Platform 🚀

VIBE-coding is a **GenAI-powered learning platform** designed to help students prepare for exams using **Previous Year Questions (PYQs)** in a smarter and more personalized way.

Instead of just solving questions, PrepPulse **tracks student progress**, identifies **weak areas**, and uses **Generative AI** to turn mistakes into learning opportunities.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Students regularly solve PYQs for exams, but they face major problems:
- They don’t know **which topics they are weak in**
- They repeat the **same mistakes**
- They lack **personalized practice and revision**
- Wrong answers only reduce confidence, not improve understanding

---

## 💡 Our Solution

PrepPulse solves this by creating an **adaptive learning flow**:

1. Students solve PYQs for any exam
2. The system tracks:
   - Correct answers
   - Incorrect answers
   - Topic-wise performance
3. When a student answers a question wrong:
   - Similar type questions are generated
   - Flashcards are created for quick revision
   - Short notes are provided to strengthen concepts
4. This process helps students **improve confidence and understanding**, not just scores
